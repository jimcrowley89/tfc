						<i>The Midnight Meat Train</i> is a real journey of a movie. It's got a variety of interesting qualities--the distinctly urban setting, a solid and creative plot, an intruiging mystery--all held together by a strong performance from Bradley Cooper. It's a weird little piece that delivers way more than what you'd expect from a movie about a <i>Midnight Meat Train</i>.
					</p><p>
						Essentially, this is a thriller about a journalist who discovers something <b>really weird</b> going on in the subways. It's a simple premise, but as he investigates, this movie takes some twists and turns that surprised me. Even the tone shifts and changes as it goes along, gradually becoming more bizarre and surreal as it explains itself. But even with the twists, <i>Midnight Meat Train</i> feels more like a popcorn movie than anything super deep or complex.
					</p><p>
						This is a fun one, nothing too complicated, but doesn't pull any punches. I think it's got a lot to offer for the halloween season. 
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This movie gets pretty gory and nasty at times, so if you're not down with some light body horror, maybe skip this one.

						<i>Leprechaun</i> strikes a really great balance between horror and comedy. For such a goofball premise, it's surprisingly solid in its construction, and has enough depth to feel like a "real" movie. It also features an hilarious appearance by Jennifer Anniston <b>just</b> before she got famous.
					</p><p>
						But speaking of performances, this movie's real draw is the charismatic monster, the Leprechaun. It reminds me of <i>Child's Play</i> in that way, where the monster is funny without losing that sense of danger. And similar to <i>Child's Play</i>, the leprechaun is portrayed by a real actor: Warwick Davis, who's way tied in to the <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i> franchises. 
					</p><p>
						<i>Leprechaun</i> works great as a party movie. It's great to watch alone. It's fun, and creative, and more legitimate than you might expect. It's maybe not "great" in a traditional sense, but that honestly works to the movie's benefit. It's definitely worth a watch.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This movie pulls out the drunken irishman trope almost instantly, and I think that's appropriate, because this one would pair well with a few beers.

						The <i>Final Destination</i> franchise is strangely iconic, something of a meme. I think that's fairly well-deserved given the unique premise; what if fate itself was trying to kill you? This first film in the franchise does a pretty good job of living up to that idea, even if it does get a little lost in the details.
					</p><p>
						The idea is straightforward enough: a bunch of teenagers narrowly avoid death, but then death decides to come for them anyway. But I think it's common knowledge what these movies really are: a platform to string together a bunch of elaborate death sequences. <i>Final Destination</i>, being the first in the series, is a bit more modest than some of the later entries, but still has a handful of scenes that stick with you well after the fact. 
					</p><p>
						Unlike a lot of horror franchises, I think <i>Final Destination</i> probably got better as it went along and found its groove, but this first entry is a fine one to examine. The cast is good, the plot is pretty tight, and the production value is there. An easy watch, alone or with friends.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This movie is very much about turn-of-the-century teenagers. It may be a litle edgier than what we see in theaters today.

						The second film in the <i>Cube</i> trilogy takes the series in a slightly different direction, straight-up adding an entire genre that wasn't in the first one: sci-fi. The "monster" in this movie is theoretical physics, which pairs well with <i>Cube</i>'s more philosophical take on horror. It's a lot like the first one, but with a new and interesting twist. 
					</p><p>
						That said, such an ambitious premise definitely creates some weirdness. "Mindfuck" is a good way to describe a lot of what goes on in this movie. It gets quite a bit more esoteric than the first <i>Cube</i>, which is cool if you're into that, but it does become a little harder to conceptualize. Still, the horror is good, and if you like the first one, <i>Hypercube</i> delivers a very similar experience. Of special note is the creative and extensive use of early CGI, which is pretty cool to see. 
					</p><p>
						<i>Cube 2: Hypercube</i> is definitely a unique movie, even compared to others in the series. Even if the plot comes out a little blurry, there are some standout scenes that you're unlikely to forget. 
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						Visually, this movie is <b>EXTREMELY</b> bright, like staring into the sun. Unlike most of the films that appear on this list, <i>Cube 2</i> is not really something you want to watch in a pitch-black room.

						This one is fuckin' <u>nasty</u>. Don't get me wrong--it's an indie film, it's quiet and dark and complex. It's more like <i>The Exorcist</i> than <i>Friday the 13th</i>, which I see as good thing.
					</p><p>
						<i>The Blackcoat's Daughter</i> is essentially about a youg girl who gets possessed by a demon (or does she?). But this one's a little different. It's more about the emotional toll, the trauma that our characters go through. There's a nice little non-linear story thing going on, too, which gives the movie more depth and mystery. It's slow, but the acting and cinematography are so striking that I think it carries itself well.
					</p><p>
						This one's a bit of a challenge, but I'd argue it's one of the better horror films of the past decade. It's definitely a required watch for any hardcore horror fan.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						<i>The Blackcoat's Daughter</i> is very subtle, it requires close attention to really appreciate it. It's not a great choice for a halloween party.

						<i>The Lost Boys</i> is an interesting piece, and one that is a little more underground than I think it deserves. It has its following, sure, but it feels more like a straight-up classic than a cult film. It strikes a great balance between horror and comedy--it's funny and charming, but pretty hardcore when it comes to the spooky stuff. 
					</p><p>
						In a nutshell, two teenage brothers move to a new town, and the older of them falls in with a <b>bad</b> crowd. The brothers, along with a handful of unlikely allies, have to band together and fight to save themselves--and the town--from this terrifying menace (no spoilers). It's a simple enough setup that gradually leads to a batshit confrontation in the end. 
					</p><p>
						The real take-away here is in the details. The story is solid, but it's the performances, the effects, the mystery and reveal, all the craftwork that sets this one apart. <i>The Lost Boys</i> is a delight from beginning to end and a great addition to this year's <class="chiller">Challenge.</class>

						It's not often you see a wholly original idea show up in the horror genre--or any genre, really--but <i>Jeepers Creepers</i> comes pretty close to doing just that. "The Creeper" is a unique monster, one you haven't seen before, one who plays by his own rules. It reminds me of <i>Candyman</i>, where the fun is in gradually discovering the lore as you go along. 
					</p><p>
						<i>Jeepers Creepers</i> takes full advantage of this mechanic, and supplements it with a solid composition. The pacing is on point, flowing naturally from scene to scene, and the characters are perfect for what the movie is trying to do. Justin Long does a great job as a panicked teenager, and the dude playing The Creeper gives the silent monster a lot of charisma.
					</p><p>
						The story is extremely simple: two kids on a cross-country trip attract the attention of a deadly-ass monster. It honestly reminds me more of a fairy tale or urban legend than a traditional movie plot, which I think works to the movie's benefit. This one's fun and easy to watch, but with a surprising amount of depth.

						This is our first Stephen King adaptation of this year's list. It's a fine one that has carved out a niche for itself in pop culture. <i>Pet Sematary</i> is a thought-provoking and unpleasant movie about loss, pain and madness, with just enough miscalculations to make parts of it very funny.
					</p><p>
						Now, the plot's kind of important to this one, so I won't spoil it if you're not familiar. But I will say it's all about death. Obviously that's a heavy topic, but <i>Pet Sematary</i> creates a sort of otherworldly vibe that keeps it from being too unpleasant to watch. And as I mentioned above, some components of this movie are so absurd as to be kind of funny, which I think adds a lot to the overall impact of the film.
					</p><p>
						This one's got a lot to offer, it's very deep and thoughtful and layered. It's got that instantly-recognizable Stephen King voice to it, and fundamentally it's just a well-constructed horror story. 
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>

						What started as a knockoff of <i>Gremlins</i> ended up as its own interesting little set of monster movies with the <i>Critters</i> franchise. <i>Critters 2</i> is the last one we're going to be covering, and it's a perfectly good sequel that highlights all the best stuff from the first one.
					</p><p>
						<i>Critters 2</i> is equal parts comedy and horror, and it meets the mark on both. The critters are lively, and cheeky, while still being very threatening, and all the special effects and puppetry are impressive. This movie doesn't waste any time, either: the action picks up early and essentially never stops. There are some great set pieces, memorable moments, and genuinely funny bits. It's solid writing brought to life by well-executed practical effects. 
					</p><p>
						Now, don't get me wrong, this is a B-movie. But <i>Critters 2</i> leans into that in just the right way, not taking itself too seriously but still living up to its premise. It's a fun watch, alone or with a group.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>

						It's hard to even try to put this film into words. One thing I can say for absolute certain about <i>Skinamarink</i>: it's one of the most atypical movies I've ever seen. Experimental, avant-garde, indie--even these labels barely describe what this one's going for.
					</p><p>
						To my eye, this is a movie about liminal spaces. If you're unfamiliar, it's basically the idea that empty spaces, that should be full and active, have an uncanny quality that makes them spooky. <i>Skinamarink</i> hits this concept hard by essentially asking, "how empty can you make a movie?" And the answer is almost hard to believe--this shit is like a content vacuum. Even the dialogue, rare as it is, is borderline imperceptible, to the point that this movie subtitles itself just so you can understand it at all.
					</p><p>
						Honestly, there's too much to talk about to cover it here. You can barely see it, you can barely hear it, it's truly a fucking bizarre movie. I think that <i>Skinamarink</i> is trying to capture that distinct feeling you have as a kid, alone in your bed in a dimly-lit bedroom, pitch-black closet just a few feet away. And to its credit, this one has stuck in my brain in a way that most films don't.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						Look, I'm not gonna lie, this one's tough to watch. But whatever happens, make sure you catch the last five or so minutes, because that's what brought it all together for me.

						There's a whole lot of interesting stuff going on in <i>Lake Mungo</i>. It rests decidedly on the slow, subtle, and spooky side of horror, to the point that it's barely horror at all. More than anything, it's the story of a sad family who lost their daughter under mysterious circumstances, who want to move on but can't. In fact, when the horror finally shows up, it's a bit of a surprise.
					</p><p>
						The most obviously interesting thing about <i>Lake Mungo</i> is the format. This movie is filmed like a documentary--a horror mockumentary. It sort of reminds me of <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> that way, instantly getting rid of any unreliable narrator problems and presenting everything as pure fact. It's beautifully shot with modern cameras, too, adding to the sense of stark realism. And the content plays around with this, teases the audience by going back and forth on the "reality" of what happened.
					</p><p>
						This one is complex, it takes its time getting into your head. <i>Lake Mungo</i> is bold in its subtlety, and while not the flashiest movie on this year's list, it's got something very unique to offer to any horror fan.

						<i>The Serpent and the Rainbow</i> is a really cool movie, but it's a weird one, too. It's dense; almost like it packed three or four movies together into one package, but not in a bad way.

					</p><p>
						 Basically, an adventurous scientist goes to Haiti in search of a rare medicinal herb, but gradually gets wrapped up in the local voodoo culture. It soon becomes a desperate fight to avoid a fate worse than death. Actually, there are a handful of fates-worse-than-death in <i>The Serpent and the Rainbow</i>, and it doesn't pull any punches in portraying them, either. Bill Pullman stars in this Wes Craven-directed nightmare of a film that's hard to forget. 
					</p><p>
						This is an ambitious film and I think it holds together well. It creates a distinct and exotic environment that feels just a little too realistic for comfort. It's not exactly a "party" movie, but it's not boring either. A good balance, especially given all the ground it covers.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This one's neat but it's pretty nasty at times, and pretty sexy at other times. Don't watch it with grandma unless she's <b>really</b> cool.

						So this is a George Romero movie, made between <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> and <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, and man, it's one hell of a piece. You can really see where the guy's head was at during this period, because <i>The Crazies</i> shares a lot of common themes with both those other films. 
					</p><p>
						Imagine this: you're watching <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, but instead of focusing on civilians, you're following the military as it tries to respond to the disaster. That's this movie. Impressively, this manages to be a <b>lot</b> more fucked-up, with scene after scene of marines just mowing down innocent insane people. If you don't count zombies, this movie has easily the highest body count of any Romero film. In fact I'm having trouble thinking of <i>any</i> movie from the 70's where this many people die on camera. 
					</p><p>
						<i>The Crazies</i> is hectic, chaotic, and remarkably fast-paced for a film of its time. There's a lot going on in this one, and it's all incredibly cynical and nasty. I can see why you never really hear about this one, but that said, it's criminally underrated and deserving of a watch.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						Pretty much everything from the 70's is dry by today's standards, so be ready for that.

											Another sequel to a previous year's movie, this secret film is absolutely <i>loaded</i> with content. Basically, it takes all the craziest parts of the first one and amplifies them to absurdity. This one barely gives you a second to catch your breath.
										</p><p>
											The director clearly had a blank check for this secret film, because it's a huge, elaborate, spare-no-expense kind of affair. Any gag they could think of got thrown in. It honestly feels more like a Warner Bros. cartoon than a horror film.
										</p><p>
											This has got to be one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year. Trust me, this one's a must-see, if only for the incredible special effects and creativity.

											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>

											Our second secret film this year is another underrated cult classic, one directed by a director we've seen before on the Challenge. It's a sad but fascinating piece about being trapped, unable to escape, surrounded by danger.
										</p><p>
											This is another adaptation of a novel, and you can really feel that. It frequently feels like a stage play where characters study complex topics and debate their ideals. Then, the danger strikes, and you get some great kills and emotional peaks. It's a dense movie that's engaging and pretty unique.
										</p><p>
											This one also features one of the wildest endings in cinema--it's kind of notorious for it. Shit gets crazy right there at the finish line.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											Like lots of book adaptations, this one is a little slower, a little more thoughtful. The dialogue is really the star in this one.

											This secret film is one that I think everybody saw when it came out, and therefore the ending is... already spoiled, I guess. But that's okay, because everyone also forgot everything about it, so it's <i>almost</i> like seeing it for the first time.
										</p><p>
											Directed by a legend, and one we've never had on the Challenge before, this movie is executed beautifully. It's tense, and spooky, and constantly zigging and zagging. The setting is so distinct that it nearly upstages some of the characters. And there's a constant driving mystery that just gets more suspicious as the movie goes along.   
										</p><p>
											This one is great, and I think it's a great way to round off this year's Challenge. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, honestly. 
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											If you've never seen it, avoid spoilers like the plague. It'll make it much better...

											Everybody knows that <i>Gremlins</i> is a top-tier classic horror movie. This year, we're going to check out the far-lesser-known sequel, which is a very different movie, but one with a lot of merit. <i>Gremlins 2</i> is a <b>far</b> more comedic film, with a bigger budget, and just as much madcap horror as the first.
										</p><p>
											This one is a live wire. You know that scene from <i>Gremlins</i>, the one where they're in the bar? Imagine an entire movie of that. <i>Gremlins 2</i> basically says "fuck it, let's just do whatever we can think of." The puppet effects are insane, the writing is insane, the cast is pretty hilarious... everything you could ask for in a

											When you're talking about horror/comedy, a good quality to look for is "zaniness." You want to go <b>way</b> over the top, with so much madness and gore that the it becomes funny. And that's <i>House</i>, man. This movie is off the chain from the first frame.
										</p><p>
											<i>House</i> is so stylized that it's actually kind of shocking at first. It's a haunted house horror movie, shot and framed like an experimental sitcom or something, and operating on cartoon logic. It's also an ensemble/party adventure--like a <i>Ghostbusters</i>, or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. And did I mention it's Japanese?
										</p><p>
											I love this movie, it's a one-of-a-kind piece that's assembled brilliantly. Unlike any other I've ever seen.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											There's a lot going on in this one, and it moves fast. Add subtitles and it can be difficult to keep up.

											<i>Tenebrae</i> is a powerhouse of an Italian slasher. To my surprise, it has worked its way onto my list of all-time favorites recently, because it's a perfect film that's also fun to watch.
										</p><p>
											This movie has a tangible energy to it, kind of like <i>Scream</i>. It <i>feels</i> distinct and unique, even though it is similar to <i>Scream</i> and a lot of other slashers, really. But <i>Tenebrae</i> takes that genre and adds a few twists and turns, covers its tracks. It also captures some fucking <b>unforgettable</b> shots on camera.
										</p><p>
											If you're just picking one secret film this year, I'd go with this one. It's such an enjoyable experience and a great way to end the season on a high note.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											No problems here, this one's chill. Happy Halloween.
