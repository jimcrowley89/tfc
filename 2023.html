						It's been quite a while now since we watched <i>28 Days Later</i>, which was a badass movie that changed the zombie game in ways that we're still living with today. So obviously you make a sequel to that, right? <i>28 Weeks Later</i> is that sequel--maybe not <i>quite</i> as good as the first one, but an interesting piece in its own right.
					</p><p>
						This is one of those franchises where if you're not super familiar with both movies, you might confuse scenes between the two of them. I think that's because <i>28 Weeks</i> has some really iconic sequences in it--scenes that would feel right at home in <i>28 Days</i>. But at the same time, this movie does its own thing, building on the gritty badass aesthetic of the series with more gunplay, bigger special effects, and quite a bit more intrigue. Sure, it goes a little over the top in a few places, but personally I find that ridiculous shit kind of charming.
					</p><p>
						<i>28 Weeks Later</i> has a lot going for it. A solid cast, cool scenes, and casual nature make it very easy to watch, and I think it's a great way to kick off this year's list.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This one's easy, but it's a very dark movie (in terms of lightning, that is). Watch in a pitch-black room for best experience.

						We see a lot of sequels on the <b class="chiller">Terrifying Challenge</b>, but now we're going to check out a prequel: made a decade and change after <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, <i>Red Dragon</i> follows a similar formula while adding a few unique flourishes of its own. 
					</p><p>
						...and talk about some wild stuff, this movie starts weird and gradually goes insane. The subtlety and deliberation of <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> is largely ditched in favor of big flamboyant showpieces. It's almost like there's a dash of <i>The Matrix</i> in there or something. We've got an all-star cast in this one, including the guy who plays Voldemort in the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies and the chick from <i>Punch Drunk Love</i>, who both absolutely nail their respective weird and complex roles. And of course, plenty of Hannibal Lecter.
					</p><p>
						This one's cool, and you don't really need to know any <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> lore; it works perfectly well as a stand-alone. Again, not as good as the first one, but a great film in its own right.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						Shouldn't be difficult, but avoid spoilers for this one if you can. Also, keep an eye out for William Blake, and see if you can remember the other movies we've watched over the years that feature him! (There're at least two others.)

					<p>
						Okay, so <i>Session 9</i> is a real deep-cut kind of movie. When you ask fans of really obscure horror for recommendations, this one comes up frequently. I think that's because it's inventive, and because it nails "spooky" and "creepy," which are both surprisingly hard to pull off. An interesting piece for sure.
					</p><p>
						One thing you notice right away about <i>Session 9</i>: you can feel the shoestring budget. Similar to an <i>Evil Dead</i> for instance, it's basically just five actors and a good location. But this movie makes that format work with creative worldbuilding, a tangibly creepy atmosphere, and a story that's rock-solid (until it's kind of not). Themes of isolation, paranoia and medical horror all blend very well into something that makes a lasting impact on the viewer.
					</p><p>
						It's weird, make no mistake. And somewhat slow as well. But it builds, and then all the sudden there's a lot going on in this obscure little movie.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						<i>Session 9</i> does take a minute to get going, so be prepared for a slow burn. Also there's some weird audio stuff, you might consider watching with headphones.

					<p>
						Another weird movie about isolation and paranoia. <i>Cabin Fever</i> is basically a gross-out boner comedy that gets attacked by a gruesome body horror, and it's pretty neat how the movie plays those two styles off each other.
					</p><p>
						It is fucking weird though. This is a plague movie, basically a bunch of college kids rent a cabin and end up at ground zero of a deadly virus outbreak. But there's plenty of other stuff that happens too--arguably too much. The effects are good, story's serviceable, and the characters are pretty strong, but what really sticks out in <i>Cabin Fever</i> is just all the bizarre shit that goes down. 
					</p><p>
						If you're skipping around, this one's a fine candidate to skip, but I think it's worth checking out. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						Being an early aughts film <i>Cabin Fever</i> is grievously offensive by today's standards, but in that mostly innocent way that like <i>Dude, Where's my Car?</i> is. Fair warning.

					<p>
						I've been trying to find a spot for this movie since the very first year of the <b class="chiller">Challenge</b>, and now the day has finally come. <i>Cube</i> is a really interesting little piece that manages to do a lot with a fairly simple premise. 
					</p><p>
						Probably the most memorable part of this movie is the setting, because the set itself has an undeniable charisma. The Cube is extremely cool-looking and almost acts as a character--its goals drive the plot along more than the protagonists do. The whole movie ends up feeling kind of like a stage play where there's nothing on screen except for the actors and their interactions, all set against the backdrop of the Cube.
					</p><p>
						This movie has achieved minor cult status mostly because it's got that unique composition and concept. It's another one that hardcore horror fans will certainly know, if only by reputation. 
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						<i>The Cube</i> is cool and stylish but it's also very methodical. It's less about action and more about slow building tension--but it's not a big deal because the runtime is pretty short.

						Everybody knows <i>Gremlins</i>, right? It's a top-tier classic. Another great horror comedy, this movie nails it on both the concept and execution in a way that most don't.
					</p><p>
						This one's iconic, and there's a lot to love about it. <i>Gremlins</i> strikes an amazing balance between scary and funny that rivals the best. Sort of like Chucky, the gremlins themselves are entertaining to watch while still being a very real threat. And the puppetry is so seamless that you can buy them as real, which is damn hard to pull off.

						Last year we watched <i>Critters</i>, which is basically a (good) rip-off. This year, we'll see the movie that inspired it.

						What if The Phantom of the Opera was a rock star? That's sort of the basic premise of this one, but there's a lot more going on. The oldest movie on this year's list is also one of the weirdest--which is a competetive category. 
					</p><p>
						<i>Phantom of the Paradise</i> is written and directed by Brian DePalma, who also directed <i>The Fury</i>, if you happened to catch that one. This movie is fucking dripping with style. The closest thing to compare it to is <i>Rocky Horror</i>, but in this one the musical numbers are also integral to the plot. The way the music is woven into the tapestry of the overall film is quite impressive (and it's catchy, too). But make no mistake: the film-making comes first, and there're some surprisingly haunting shots in this otherwise wild movie.
					</p><p>
						Also, and this feels weird to say, but The Phantom is maybe one of my all-time favorite movie monsters. He's bizzare and complex and scary and sympathetic all at once, and every time he's on the screen I'm happy. Plus, the female star of <i>Suspiria</i> is in this movie, as if it wasn't enough of an oddball already.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						I mean, this is from the seventies. Things had a different flow back then. <i>Phantom</i> plays kind of like <i>The Exorcist</i> or <i>Texas Chainsaw</i>, so be prepared for that.

					<p>
						A few years ago now we saw the original <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, a movie that heavily inspired zombie culture for decades and still does today. This <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> is a more sleek and modern version of that same premise, made to be a bit more exciting and action-packed than the original while still paying respect to its roots. 
					</p><p>
						First thing to note is that this <i>Dawn</i> is a "fast zombie" film, as opposed to the slow lumbering undead of the original. This was an early adopter of the fast zombie, coming out only a couple of years after <i>28 Days Later</i>. The gore effects have been greatly updated as well; the movie wisely leans into this by having <b>substantially</b> more gruesome violence than its predecessor.
					</p><p>
						And maybe most impressively, this <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> manages to work in that tongue-in-cheek attitude from the original despite it being a very different movie. It's clear that, in both films, being fun was a big priority.

						This is barely even a horror movie if I'm being honest. But despite that, it fits perfectly into this year's roster just beccause of how strange (and insanely violent) it is. This is another spoiler movie where it's difficult to describe it without giving away the goods. What I'll say is that this movie moves at a break-neck pace from the very first scene, and is constantly doubling down until the very end. It's also kind of horny, and has a strange fascination with beautiful 80's cars.

						It's hard to do a unique take on vampires. We've seen a few, but the lore is just so familiar and established that it's difficult to stray. As far as these things go, though, <i>Lifeforce</i> sets itself apart with a batshit insane take on the classic movie monster.
					</p><p>
						So this one's interesting for a lot of reasons. For a grand scale blockbuster-style movie, it was shot on a pretty modest budget, but they knew where to put their money. The effects look a little cheap--but they're so technically well-done that they're just cool to look at. <i>Lifeforce</i> is directed by Tobe Hooper, the same guy who did <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> and <i>Poltergeist</i>, and you can see that level of vision in this one, too. By the end this movie gets pretty wild.

						We're going to round it out this year with a demented little Lovecraftian horror. <i>The Void</i> doesn't pull any punches--it's dark, and nasty, and desperately hopeless all the way through. This movie really goes for it.
					</p><p>
						Over the years my appreciation for the Lovecraftian genre has only grown. One big reason for that is how well it pairs with body horror, which we've seen in <i>The Color Out of Space</i> and <i>In the Mouth of Madness</i>. And this movie leans into that in a big way; at a certain point nearly every scene becomes drenched with gore. <i>The Void</i> starts slow and unassuming, but every minute the stakes get higher and shit gets weirder. A small but sturdy cast of characters keeps this bizarre movie anchored to reality... until it doesn't. 
					</p><p>
						I enjoyed this one a lot. It kind of feels like a long episode of <i>The X-Files</i> (which is a good thing). I think it would make a great Call of Cthulhu adventure. 
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This one's pretty nasty on a few levels. Try and watch it in the dark.

											One of our themes this year is isolation, and few movies do it like this one does. From the very beginning there's something lurking out in the shadows, waiting to strike.
										</p><p>
											Our first secret film is an absolute classic. I hadn't seen it since I was a kid, and watching it recently it's hard to believe. This movie is beautiful to look at, the effects are insane, and it's so nasty and ominous. It's got worldbuilding and acting and all that shit. Everything you could want from an atmospheric horror movie. 
										</p><p>
											Now it's a bit older, a bit slower than what we're used to these days. It's all about building tension--gradually closing in around you until you feel trapped. I think every horror enthusiast should have this one under their belt.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											It's slow, but that's by design. And it's really more sci-fi than horror especially at the beginning.

											Fair warning: you've never heard of this movie. No one has. It doesn't have any sort of cult following, it's not a deep cut, it's a totally random movie among thousands that have never gotten any sort of attention.
										</p><p>
											But this one's special. There's something about it that's hard to place. Production-wise it feels like a B-movie, cheap and quickly put together, but the story is so much more creative than those types usually are. Sure, the writing follows some old formulas--but there's a twist, a gimmick that makes the whole thing feel very personal. 
										</p><p>
											This secret film is fun and fairly casual, but at the same time it's also uniquely uncomfortable. It's a fresh take on an old story, and I think it has a lot to offer.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											This one starts a little... predictably, I guess? But it ends exactly the opposite. Just let it run.

											This is one of those movies that I've been hearing about my entire life but had never seen. Now I see what all the fuss was about.
										</p><p>
											Secret Film 3 is unbelievable. Every element is executed perfectly--and it's not a simple movie. There's a whole lot going on in this one. Huge special effects, musical numbers, cameos, camera tricks, and some seriously dark subject matter make Secret Film 3 unforgettable. It's maybe not the most horrific movie ever, but it's something worth seeing.

											It may seem like a strange choice to round out the year, but I think this one is a must-see.

										<p>
											Despite being a little more under-the-radar than most, <i>Possession</i> is absolutely one of those top-tier masterpieces in league with your <i>Shinings</i> and <i>Chainsaw Massacres</i>. It's dark, it's greasy, and most importantly it's <b>super weird</b>.
										</p><p>
											And I know it's been a weird year in general, but seriously, this one is something different. Much of <i>Possession</i> is a tense drama, but it's horrific from the very start. You can feel the claustrophobia and paranoia in every scene--and that's before the nightmare shit start showing up. Everything just keeps devolving into delirium and darkness. It's great.
										</p><p>
											Not to mention the craftwork in this movie, which is insane. Gorgeous camera work, playing with light and depth, borders on experimental without breaking immersion. Great actors turn in some truly wild performances. The special effects are disgustingly believable, so much so that you kind of forget they're effects. I can't recommend it enough.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											This one would not be fun to drink to. It's more of a dismal nightmare movie so plan accordingly. Oh, and it's grossly sexual too.

											When you're talking about horror/comedy, a good quality to look for is "zaniness." You want to go <b>way</b> over the top, with so much madness and gore that the it becomes funny. And that's <i>House</i>, man. This movie is off the chain from the first frame.
										</p><p>
											<i>House</i> is so stylized that it's actually kind of shocking at first. It's a haunted house horror movie, shot and framed like an experimental sitcom or something, and operating on cartoon logic. It's also an ensemble/party adventure--like a <i>Ghostbusters</i>, or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. And did I mention it's Japanese?
										</p><p>
											I love this movie, it's a one-of-a-kind piece that's assembled brilliantly. Unlike any other I've ever seen.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											There's a lot going on in this one, and it moves fast. Add subtitles and it can be difficult to keep up.

											<i>Tenebrae</i> is a powerhouse of an Italian slasher. To my surprise, it has worked its way onto my list of all-time favorites recently, because it's a perfect film that's also fun to watch.
										</p><p>
											This movie has a tangible energy to it, kind of like <i>Scream</i>. It <i>feels</i> distinct and unique, even though it is similar to <i>Scream</i> and a lot of other slashers, really. But <i>Tenebrae</i> takes that genre and adds a few twists and turns, covers its tracks. It also captures some fucking <b>unforgettable</b> shots on camera.
										</p><p>
											If you're just picking one secret film this year, I'd go with this one. It's such an enjoyable experience and a great way to end the season on a high note.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											No problems here, this one's chill. Happy Halloween.
