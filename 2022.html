						Let's start with a hell of a movie: <i>Scream</i>. This one is cool because it plays like a casual teen slasher, but it's also a dense and introspective film. Very aware of its own tropes, <i>Scream</i> plays with genre in a natural and entertaining way.
					</p><p>
						First off the pacing in this movie is crazy, it flows from kill to conversation without missing a beat. The camera work is distinct and frenetic, which makes the whole thing sort of stand out in your memory. And then there's a whole mess of talented actors (including our first Shaggy of the year). Henry Winkler's in it, Drew Barrymore, Seth Green. It's nuts.
					</p><p>
						<i>Scream</i> is very polished, very slick, but in a nineties kind of way. There's a lot going on with this one, and I'm psyched to watch it again.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						You can watch this one as casually as you want. It's just a touch long, but that's not a bad thing.

						Let's talk about <i>Psycho.</i> It's an iconic film, and has a lot of things going for it, but it's also really <i>weird</i>. It's a gritty and surreal sort of movie that's bizarre even by today's standards.
					</p><p>
						<i>Psycho</i> is incredibly tense, unsettling, and in spots is also pretty brutal. But it really operates more like a mystery than a modern slasher: there's a lot of little details and investigations and characters just talking to each other. Every scene is executed perfectly, but it might not be what you expect from a movie called <i>Psycho.</i>
					</p><p>
						Also: if you've never seen this movie before, if you don't know the twists and turns it takes, then make sure to <b>avoid spoilers</b>. Go in as fresh as you possibly can (trust me).
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						It helps to approach this one like a mystery rather than a slasher. The first thirty or so minutes are setting up that mystery, so get through that and you'll be golden.

						There's so much to love about this one--great writing, quick pacing, killer soundtrack.
						Brandon Lee is a national treasure in this film, and the whole cast nails every performance (keep an eye out for some familiar actors).
					</p><p>
						And finally there's my favorite part: the tone.
						Though badass and action-packed, <i>The Crow</i> is a tragedy.
						The whole movie is held together by a constant sadness that's surprisingly fun to watch.

						This movie pretty casual. It's got a nice dash of sci-fi which it uses to good effect, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.
						There's also some clever little details in the writing that keeps things fresh--and it knows not to overstay its welcome.

						It's pretty great for a killer doll movie.
					</p><p>
						I'm starting to come around on some of these eighties pop-horror movies.
						<i>Child's play</i> is interesting in that it has a charismatic monster.
						Chucky is a homicidal maniac, sure, but he's also kind of funny--and at times nearly sympathetic.
						It's such a weird situation, but it works.
					</p><p>
						Quick shoutout to Brad Dourif (the gemini killer in <i>Exorcist III</i>) for carrying this film with his performance of a homicidal doll.

						<i>Psycho II</i> is interesting because it pretty well captures the spirit of the original without feeling like a cheap knockoff.
						Like the original, it's a mystery/slasher, it takes place mostly in the Bates house, and it centers around the character of Norman Bates.
						It expands on <i>Psycho</i> in an organic way that's surprisingly faithful to its source material.
					</p><p>
						Every element has strong execution, but I really appreciate the writing especially.
						The plot is great, but for me it's all the fine details that really bring this movie to life.
						It may not be a Hitchcock but it's pretty damn good.

											Here we have another of my all-time favorites, a godawful nightmare of a film filled with paranoia, madness and sweat. It is really uncomfortable.
										</p><p>
											Secret film 1 is often compared to <b><i>The Exorcist</i></b>, and not in a bad way. But I would argue this movie is quite a bit more morbid. It's nastier. And that morbid nastiness is probably the reason this one is a little less well-known.
										</p><p>
											It's also one of those "fever dream" movies that feels like delirium. There's some sort of weird mystery or mythology at play but you never quite get to pin it down. It'll nag you.

											This shit is nuts. From the first few minutes I could tell this was going to be a wild ride, and it definitely stuck the landing on that one.
										</p><p>
											Talk about a unique movie, secret film 2 is unlike any I've seen before. It's wildly distinct on both a visual and storytelling level, which is exactly what you want out of a comedy/horror. This movie had me laughing the whole time.
										</p><p>
											Here's your big hint for this secret film: it's foreign. Foreign and kind of old. You can <i>really</i> feel the country of origin on this one.

											We have a variety of slashers on the list this year, but this one is my favorite: a layered, driven and bizarre piece called secret film 3.
										</p><p>
											This one comes to us from a director we already know. It moves pretty quick for a mystery, and has some truly dynamic kills. It also has a strong soundtrack--strong enough to be a clue.
										</p><p>
											I've already seen this movie twice this year, and yet I can't wait to watch it again.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											Secret film 3 is weird, but it's a relaxed weird. Strap in and see if you can solve the mystery.

										<p>
											Despite being a little more under-the-radar than most, <i>Possession</i> is absolutely one of those top-tier masterpieces in league with your <i>Shinings</i> and <i>Chainsaw Massacres</i>. It's dark, it's greasy, and most importantly it's <b>super weird</b>.
										</p><p>
											And I know it's been a weird year in general, but seriously, this one is something different. Much of <i>Possession</i> is a tense drama, but it's horrific from the very start. You can feel the claustrophobia and paranoia in every scene--and that's before the nightmare shit start showing up. Everything just keeps devolving into delirium and darkness. It's great.
										</p><p>
											Not to mention the craftwork in this movie, which is insane. Gorgeous camera work, playing with light and depth, borders on experimental without breaking immersion. Great actors turn in some truly wild performances. The special effects are disgustingly believable, so much so that you kind of forget they're effects. I can't recommend it enough.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											This one would not be fun to drink to. It's more of a dismal nightmare movie so plan accordingly. Oh, and it's grossly sexual too.

											When you're talking about horror/comedy, a good quality to look for is "zaniness." You want to go <b>way</b> over the top, with so much madness and gore that the it becomes funny. And that's <i>House</i>, man. This movie is off the chain from the first frame.
										</p><p>
											<i>House</i> is so stylized that it's actually kind of shocking at first. It's a haunted house horror movie, shot and framed like an experimental sitcom or something, and operating on cartoon logic. It's also an ensemble/party adventure--like a <i>Ghostbusters</i>, or <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. And did I mention it's Japanese?
										</p><p>
											I love this movie, it's a one-of-a-kind piece that's assembled brilliantly. Unlike any other I've ever seen.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											There's a lot going on in this one, and it moves fast. Add subtitles and it can be difficult to keep up.

											<i>Tenebrae</i> is a powerhouse of an Italian slasher. To my surprise, it has worked its way onto my list of all-time favorites recently, because it's a perfect film that's also fun to watch.
										</p><p>
											This movie has a tangible energy to it, kind of like <i>Scream</i>. It <i>feels</i> distinct and unique, even though it is similar to <i>Scream</i> and a lot of other slashers, really. But <i>Tenebrae</i> takes that genre and adds a few twists and turns, covers its tracks. It also captures some fucking <b>unforgettable</b> shots on camera.
										</p><p>
											If you're just picking one secret film this year, I'd go with this one. It's such an enjoyable experience and a great way to end the season on a high note.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											No problems here, this one's chill. Happy Halloween.
