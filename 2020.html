						If you're looking for a horror film that absolutely kicks ass, <i>Blade</i> is the way to go.
						We're starting the list off with a bang this year.
					</p><p>
						<i>Blade</i> was made right around the same time as <i>The Matrix</i>, and the similarities are noticeable.
						It decidedly has that same turn-of-the-centruy action movie feel.
						And like <i>Matrix</i>, this film also has some surprisingly strong plot and worldbuilding elements to it as well.
						The acting is highly competent, and the action sequences only serve to add to the story. Classic stuff.
					</p><p>
						<i>Blade</i> is a strong-ass movie, and one that I feel hasn't gotten the credit it deserves.
						Action-Horror is deceptively difficult to make, but this one stands a perfect model.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This one's easy. Grab a few beers and kick back. And get ready, because <i>Blade</i> hits the ground running.

						This is a movie that's very close to my heart. Not only is it a great film, but it's loosely based on an old Tennessee legend that took place not that far from where I grew up.
						And I'd bet it's been awhile since you've last seen it, so here it is: <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>.
					</p><p>
						This movie is entirely responsible for the genre of found footage. Hell, it's still one of the best examples of that genre.
						This movie is driven by a constant, building tension that starts early and snowballs viciously by the end.
						It's also one of the few movies featuring a hag as its main antagonist (at least ostensibly), which is a totally under-utilized type of monster. Love this one.
					</p><p>
						While <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> is a little slow, that's by design.
						It's built to spook you out, get you afraid of the dark for a while. Give it a chance.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						Oh, I'd absolutely turn the lights out for this one. This movie works best in the dark, one-on-one.

						This film was a perfect storm. It had a novel (at the time) concept, great execution, a passable plot, and some stunning visuals.
						<i>Saw</i> basically kicked off a whole new sub-genre of horror that we're still living with today--I'd call it modern surrealist toture-porn.

						<i>Altered States</i> is basically a modern take on the old <i>Jekyll and Hyde</i> story.

						First off, this one might be hard to find. It's a pretty fucking obscure movie. But if you can get ahold of it, I'd say don't watch it while sleepy.

					</p><p>
						<i>From Beyond</i> is a spiritual sucessor to <i>Re-Animator</i>, one of my favorite movies of all time.
						It has many of the same actors, the same director, and was made only years after.
						And while the tone is a little more serious, it still stands as a pretty great entry into the Lovecraftian horror genre.
					</p><p>
						While it's hard to follow a masterpiece like <i>Re-Animator</i>, this movie has a lot of merit in its own right.
						The effects are great, the story is strong, and the visuals very hard to forget. A wild cinematic experience.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This movie is pretty gory. And like <i>Re-Animator</i> it has a weird psycho-sexual vibe to it that might turn some people off. I wouldn't put it on in mixed company.

					</p><p>
						It blows my mind to say this, but I'm pretty sure <i>Evil Dead 2</i> (another one of my favorites) took a great deal of inspiration from <i>House</i>.
						Watch for it. But make no mistake: <i>House</i> is its own movie. There's a lot of crazy stuff in here that you won't see in a typical horror movie.
						And while the story is pretty straightforward, there's some serious twists and turns that'll really catch you off-guard.
					</p><p>
						<i>House</i> is a goofy story that is executed masterfully. It goes off the rails very quickly--in exactly the way you'd want.
						A nice break from the extreme horror you'll find on the rest of the list.

						<i>Battle Royale</i> is a japanese film, making it our first forgeign film for the year.

						Now, keep in mind that this movie was made in the 60s. It's slow, and brooding, and philosophical. It's really more of a character drama than anything.
						But it's most obviously notable for creating the Romero zombie, which is essentially the zombie we know today.
						Before <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, pretty much the only kind of zombie was voodoo (which is objectively the most boring kind).
					</p><p>
						<i>Night of the Living Dead</i> was highly influential, but it's also a great movie in its own right. The visuals are beautiful, and the monsters ghoulish.

						It blends perfectly the oldschool gravity and emotional intensity with modern filmmaking and visuals. Damn it's good.
					</p><p>
						<i>Hereditary</i> is made by the same director of <i>Midsommar</i> which is an equally good movie.
						And like <i>Midsommar</i>, this movie contains a startling amount of actual occult shit.
						It creates a fascinating sort of "realism" and believability that you don't usually get from a horror movie.
					</p><p>
						This film is a stick-with-you kind of piece. It's really beautiful in a lot of ways, and honestly gives me a lot of hope for the future of cinema.
					</p><p>
						<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
						This movie is best watched in the dark, and perfect silence if you can get it. Gird your loins for <i>Hereditary</i>.

											We start off this year's Mystery Movie selection with a cult classic.
											One that you may or may not be familiar with, but that decidedly influenced all films in its genre--and indeed, horror culture itself.
										</p><p>
											This movie is brutal. It's a pretty straightforward member of its class, but with a few little twists that amplify the whole.
											It's got a direct relation to another great horror film; and indeed, that film appears earlier on this very list.
										</p><p>
											This Mystery Movie is a classic concept, amazingly executed.
											It stands out among the multitude of similar films for many reasons... all of which you'll find out soon enough.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											No wrong way to watch this movie. Easily the most accesible Mystery Movie this year. It's even--dare I say--fun?

											Now here we have an interesting piece. One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen that still manages to have a plot.
											And given the story behind the movie, it basically has two plots.
										</p><p>
											I almost hesitate to recommend this movie, because in technical terms it's not very "good."
											It's an indie film, and not even one made by professionals.
											But while some elements of a great film are missing, the artist's vision is <b>THERE</b>.
											This is a story that desperately needed to be told.
										</p><p>
											In contrast to this year's first Mystery Movie, our second is totally unique.
											It's anything but a genre picture. And whether or not you can make sense of it, this one will make an impact.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											I don't know if it's better to give this one your full attention, or let it seep in past your conscious mind.
											Best I can do is wish you luck.

											And here we go! We're starting this year's Secret Film selections with a heavy hitter. <i>Return of the Living Dead</i> is a criminally unknown entry into the zombie movie genre. This one is a must-see.
										</p><p>
											This movie has it all: great ideas, powerful writing, amazing practical effects, awesome soundtrack, strong acting, memorable characters--just about anything you could want in a movie (oh, and full-frontal). It was also written by the co-writer of another movie on this year's list: the legendary <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>. That said, make no mistake, <i>Return of the Living Dead</i> is its own unique piece.
										</p><p>
											While this is without a doubt the most "fun" Secret Film of the year, it's still a dark, grisly-ass nightmare of a movie. Make sure to give it a close watch; the devil's in the details with this one.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											Great movie, easy to watch. Might want to save this one for Halloween night, as this year's other Secret Films are fucking <i>bleak</i>. That said, it's really hard to find a good stream of this one. You might want to consider renting it from Amazon (worth every penny).

											Now, this is a <i>weird</i> one. I really am not even sure how to talk about it. Not just to avoid spoilers, but because the content is just difficult to even quantify. Also it has the same name as a video game which came out a few years ago, which is distracting. Anyway...
										</p><p>
											Uh, this movie hits you very similar to a nightmare. Everything that happens seems... impermanent somehow. Transitory. The characters are flat and illogical at times, but that only serves to strengthen the bizarre tonality.
										</p><p>
											That said, let's address the quality of this film. Because that's an important thing. <i>The Evil Within</i> is a little flawed. As in, it's not exactly a <i>great</i> movie. But the fact that I'd slot it on this list anyway should give you some indication of what you're in for. I won't say much more, except that it's fucking unforgettable.
										</p><p>
											Check this one out. See what you can take from it. There's something in there--something deep and dark and alien. You won't regret it.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											Okay so first off I'd try a meditative approach to this movie. Don't try to hard to get a grasp on it, just let it happen. Trust me, it all comes together in the end.
											Also: <i>The Evil Within</i> comes with some bonus content. The backstory of this movie is fucking BIZARRE.
											Once you've watched it, go listen to the creation story <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://deadrabbitradio.libsyn.com/ep-58-mexican-sugar-dancing"><b><u>here</b></u></a> (make sure to skip about halfway through). Believe me, it elevates this movie to another level.

											Holy shit, I love this movie. Goddam. But fair warning: I'm a sick fucker, and that's the target audience for <i>The House That Jack Built</i>. Seriously, strap your ass in for this one.
										</p><p>
											The director of this movie, a man named Lars von Trier, is an absolute madman. His movies are all the same in one important aspect: they don't care about your feelings. "Offensive" doesn't quite cut it--this dude's movies are outrageous. Don't put this on at a party. Screen it before you show it to your friends. <b>Be careful</b>.
										</p><p>
											<i>The House That Jack Built</i> is a full-blown horror epic. It's (very) long, and (highly) painful, and totally unforgiving. It's also exquisitely beautiful at times in ways that I can't really describe here. I recommend going in <u>completely dark</u>; don't watch the trailer. Just watch the movie.
										</p><p>
											<b><u class="chiller">Beware:</u></b><br>
											This is one of those that I can't prepare you for. We'll just have to see if you can tolerate it. Cut the lights, turn off your phone, and get ready. One thing I might suggest: maybe don't watch this on Halloween night, because it's not fun <b>at all</b>. Go with <i>Return of the Living Dead</i> on the big night.
